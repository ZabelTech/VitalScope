# VitalScope: The State of You

A personal health dashboard that aggregates data from **Garmin Connect**, the **Strong** gym tracker, and **EufyLife** smart scale into a single SQLite database and visualizes it in a React frontend organized around an **OODA loop** — Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.

## Current status

All four sync sources are wrapped as **plugins** that the backend schedules and runs on an interval (APScheduler). The UI has five routes (Observe / Orient / Decide / Act / Settings). The database holds ~4.3 years of daily health metrics plus journal, supplements, nutrition, and water logs.

### Data in the database

| Source | Rows | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heart rate (daily) | 1,576 | 2021-12-19 → today | resting / min / max |
| Heart rate (readings) | 63,041 | | per-minute intraday |
| HRV (daily) | 1,083 | 2022-09-02 → today | weekly avg + baseline band |
| HRV (readings) | 8,909 | | overnight only |
| Body battery (daily) | 1,576 | 2021-12-19 → today | charged/drained totals |
| Body battery (readings) | 9,455 | | intraday level curve |
| Sleep | 1,576 | 2021-12-19 → today | stages, score, SpO2, respiration |
| Stress (daily) | 1,576 | 2021-12-19 → today | avg / max |
| Stress (readings) | 38,161 | | intraday |
| Steps | 1,472 | 2021-12-19 → today | total + goal + distance |
| Weight | 439 | 2023-04-13 → today | full body composition from Eufy smart scale |
| Garmin activities | 760 | 2019-11-21 → today | runs, rides, strength, yoga, etc. |
| Strong workouts | 292 | 2022-09-07 → 2026-04-09 | strength workouts with 6,557 sets |

## Sync — plugin system

Each data source is a plugin registered in `backend/plugins/`. At backend startup the scheduler (`AsyncIOScheduler`) loads each plugin's config from the `plugin_configs` table and schedules it at its configured interval. Every run writes a row to `plugin_runs` (started_at / finished_at / status / message).

The plugins delegate to the original `sync_*.py` scripts via `_script_runner.py`, which imports the module and calls `main()` with spoofed `sys.argv` and credentials injected into `os.environ`. The scripts are therefore usable two ways:

1. **Via the UI** — configure credentials and interval on `/settings`, click **Run now** or let the scheduler fire.
2. **Standalone CLI** — the original `python3 sync_*.py` invocations still work exactly as before.

All four scripts are **incremental by default** — they only fetch what's missing. Use `--full` / `--all` to force a complete resync.

### `sync_garmin.py`

Syncs daily health metrics from Garmin Connect using the `garminconnect` library. Stores HR, HRV, sleep, stress, body battery, and steps in daily + intraday readings tables.

**Incremental strategy**: finds `MAX(date)` across all daily tables, then re-fetches **the last 2 days** on every run to capture intraday updates (HR / stress / body battery still trickle in today, and last night's sleep is only finalized the next morning).

```bash
export GARMIN_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export GARMIN_PASSWORD="yourpassword"

python3 sync_garmin.py                         # incremental (default)
python3 sync_garmin.py --full                  # ignore DB state, resync full range
python3 sync_garmin.py --since 2021-12-19      # full historical backfill
python3 sync_garmin.py --date 2026-04-10 --days 7  # specific range
```

Tokens are cached at `~/.garminconnect` after the first login.

### `sync_garmin_activities.py`

Syncs activity sessions (runs, rides, strength, yoga, etc.) from Garmin Connect. Stores one row per activity with distance, duration, HR, power, elevation, training effect.

**Incremental strategy**: queries `MAX(start_time)` and stops paginating when activities become older than what's already stored.

### `sync_strong.py`

Syncs strength workouts from the **Strong** gym tracker. Strong has no public API — this script uses the reverse-engineered **new** REST API at `back.strong.app` (Azure Front Door / JWT auth), not the deprecated Parse Server backend at `ws13.strongapp.co`.

> ⚠️ **Account risk**: Strong has terminated accounts for unofficial API usage in the past. Use at your own risk.

**Incremental strategy**: loads the set of existing workout IDs from the DB, paginates newest-first, and stops as soon as a page contains zero new workouts.

**Data model**: `workouts` (one per session) + `workout_sets` (one per set). Rest timers are preserved as `set_type='rest'` rows interleaved with `set_type='working'` rows, so the original order is retained for display.

```bash
export STRONG_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export STRONG_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
python3 sync_strong.py           # incremental
python3 sync_strong.py --full    # resync all
```

Tokens cached at `~/.strongapp` with 20 min JWT access + refresh token.

### `sync_eufy.py`

Syncs body composition (weight, BMI, body fat, muscle, water, bone, BMR, etc.) from the **EufyLife** cloud — the smart scale's mobile app backend.

**Incremental strategy**: queries `MAX(created_at)` from `weight_readings` and passes `after=<latest - 24h>` to the Eufy API.

```bash
export EUFY_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export EUFY_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
python3 sync_eufy.py             # incremental
python3 sync_eufy.py --all       # full history
```

## Backend — `backend/app.py`

A single FastAPI file serving 51 routes from `vitalscope.db`. CORS is open to `http://localhost:5173` for the Vite dev server. On startup it creates the app-owned tables (journal, supplements, nutrition, water, plugin state) and starts the plugin scheduler.

**Route groups**:

| Group | Routes |
|---|---|
| Daily summaries | `GET /api/{heart-rate,hrv,body-battery,sleep,stress,weight,steps}/daily?start=&end=` |
| Range stats | `GET /api/{heart-rate,hrv,body-battery,sleep,stress,weight,steps}/stats?start=&end=` — `{min, max, avg, median, volatility}` |
| Body battery live | `GET /api/body-battery/current` — latest reading + today's min/max |
| Workouts (Strong) | `GET /api/workouts`, `/api/workouts/stats`, `/api/workouts/weekly-volume`, `/api/workouts/recent`, `/api/workouts/{id}` |
| Activities (Garmin) | `GET /api/activities`, `/api/activities/stats`, `/api/activities/weekly`, `/api/activities/recent` |
| Journal | `GET/POST /api/journal`, `GET /api/journal/{date}`, `GET/POST /api/journal/{date}/supplements` |
| Supplements | `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/supplements[/{id}]` |
| Nutrition | `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/meals[/{id}]`, `GET /api/nutrition/daily`, `GET/POST/DELETE /api/water[/{id}]`, `GET /api/water/daily`, `GET/POST /api/nutrients/definitions`, `DELETE /api/nutrients/definitions/{key}` |
| Plugins | `GET /api/plugins`, `GET/PUT /api/plugins/{name}`, `POST /api/plugins/{name}/run`, `GET /api/plugins/{name}/runs` |
| Meta | `GET /api/date-range` — earliest/latest date across all tables |

### Running the backend

```bash
cd /home/robert/vitalscope
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Frontend — `frontend/`

Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Recharts + react-router-dom.

### Pages (OODA loop)

Each route uses the shared `OodaPage` frame: a page title, an in-page nav of anchor links, and stacked labelled sections.

- **`/observe` Observe** — what is true right now?
  - **Today's metrics** — today's snapshot with age badges: Last Night's Sleep (score + stages + SpO2), HRV, Body Battery (current / today range / charged / drained), Stress, Body Composition, Steps, Heart Rate.
  - **Journal** — daily journal entries: alcohol, morning feeling, free-text notes, and a per-supplement check-off grouped by morning / noon / evening. Supplements default to checked for a fresh date — you only uncheck the ones you missed.
  - **Bloodwork** — placeholder.
- **`/orient` Orient** — what does the pattern look like?
  - **Trends** — historical charts with a date range picker (30d / 90d / 6mo / 1yr / All). Each metric has a row of Min / Max / Avg / Median / Volatility cards above its chart. Training chart is merged: stacked bars of weekly Garmin sessions + Strong sessions with a distance line overlay. Calories + water chart at the bottom.
  - **Activity history** — merged Garmin + Strong card list with click-to-expand details.
  - **Bloodwork** — placeholder.
- **`/decide` Decide** — what is the plan?
  - **Goals** — daily step goal (from Garmin) + placeholder for upcoming targets (sleep, HRV, RHR, weight, calories, macros).
  - **Plan** — tabs for Supplements (the master list grouped Morning/Noon/Evening, drives the Journal check-off), Food (placeholder), Activity (placeholder).
- **`/` Act** — what to do today?
  - **Today** — `TodayDashboard`: quick snapshot + recent activity card.
  - **Supplements & alcohol** — `IntakeLog`: check off today's supplements and log alcohol.
  - **Meals & water** — `NutritionPage`: log meals for a date with free-text name + time + full nutrient breakdown (Macros / Minerals / Vitamins / Bioactives, ~37 seeded keys, collapsible sections). Water is logged as separate per-drink entries with a running daily total.
- **`/settings` Settings** — sync plugins. One card per plugin (Garmin Health, Garmin Activities, Strong, Eufy) with Enabled toggle, interval, credential fields, Save, Run now, last-run status, and recent-runs log.

### Running the frontend

```bash
cd /home/robert/vitalscope/frontend
npm install    # first time only
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Vite proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Typical workflow

Day-to-day the scheduler keeps the DB fresh — no manual steps required. If you want to force a refresh:

- From the UI: `/settings` → **Run now** on the relevant plugin.
- From the CLI: the standalone scripts still work.

```bash
cd /home/robert/vitalscope && source venv/bin/activate
python3 sync_garmin.py
python3 sync_garmin_activities.py
python3 sync_strong.py
python3 sync_eufy.py
```

## Per-PR preview deploys

Every pull request gets an ephemeral Fly.io app at `https://vitalscope-pr-<N>.fly.dev`, provisioned by `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml` and torn down when the PR closes. Previews run with `VITALSCOPE_DEMO=1` — the scheduler is off, plugin credentials are inaccessible, and the SQLite file is reseeded from `seed_demo.py` on every boot so no real health data ever leaves this machine.

## Known quirks

- **Strong pagination**: Strong's REST API returns `_links.next` with empty `_embedded.log` arrays after the last real page — the sync script stops when it sees an empty logs array (not when `next` is missing).
- **Rest timers**: Strong models rest periods as `cellSet`s with only `REST_TIMER` cells. These are stored as `set_type='rest'` rows with the duration in `seconds` so the set order is preserved.
- **Garmin 429**: Garmin Connect rate-limits aggressively. The sync script pauses 60s on 429 and retries once, plus throttles 1s between days for large backfills.
- **HRV gap**: HRV data starts 2022-09-02, not 2021-12-19 — likely when the Garmin device was upgraded to one that supports HRV tracking.
- **Plugin re-entry**: plugins call into the legacy `sync_*.py` modules, which is why `_script_runner.py` has to patch `sys.argv` and credential env vars around each call.
